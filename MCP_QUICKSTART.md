## Available Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| MCP server crashes | `pip install "mcp>=1.0.0,<2.0.0"` then restart |
| Tools not showing in Copilot | `Ctrl+Shift+P` ? `Developer: Reload Window` |
| Can't connect to Pi | Check Pi is on same WiFi, run `hostname -I` on Pi |
| SSH asks for password every time | Set up SSH key (see below) |

---

## One-Time Setup — Skip Password Every Time

Run this **once** on Windows PowerShell to avoid typing Pi password on every connect:

```powershell
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
ssh-copy-id tt-11@10.100.35.56
```

After this, VS Code connects to Pi automatically with no password prompt.
